🧱 vs. 🧊 Understanding BSP and Static Meshes in Unreal Engine
Structuring your level in Unreal Engine often starts with a fundamental choice: BSP or Static Mesh? While both define your game's geometry, they serve very different purposes in a modern workflow. Let's break down the key differences.

🧱 What is BSP? (Binary Space Partitioning)
BSP brushes are primitive volumes (cubes, spheres, stairs) you can shape directly inside the Unreal Editor. Think of them as digital clay for quick prototyping.

🎯 Primary Use: Level Blocking. Quickly grey-boxing a level to test scale, gameplay flow, and composition before any final art exists.
✅ Pros:
🚀 Rapid Iteration: Resize, subtract, and add shapes in seconds without leaving the editor.
🛠️ Easy In-Editor Mods: Perfect for design iteration during early development phases.
❌ Cons:
🐢 Performance Heavy: Not optimized for runtime; too many BSPs will hurt your frame rate.
🎨 Limited Visual Fidelity: Basic geometry and material application. Not meant for final visuals.
💡 Icon: 🧱 (A brick, representing basic building blocks)

🧊 What is a Static Mesh?
Static Meshes are 3D models created in external software (like Blender, Maya, or 3ds Max) and imported into Unreal as assets. They are the building blocks of your final, polished environment.

🎯 Primary Use: Final Art Assets. Everything from complex architectural pieces to props like rocks, furniture, and weapons.
✅ Pros:
⚡ High Performance: Highly optimized for real-time rendering. They are the standard for shipped content.
✨ High Visual Fidelity: Support complex UVs, multiple material slots, LODs (Level of Detail), and custom collisions.
♻️ Reusability: A single asset can be instanced countless times across your project.
❌ Cons:
⏳ Slower Iteration: Requires a round-trip to a 3D modeling app for significant changes.
🎓 Specialized Skills: Requires knowledge of 3D modeling, UV unwrapping, and baking.

🔁 The Standard Workflow
The power comes from using them together in the right order:
📐 Phase 1: Prototyping (BSP)
Use BSP brushes to block out your entire level. Test player movement, room sizes, and sightlines. It's fast and disposable.
🎨 Phase 2: Production (Static Meshes)
Artists create beautiful, optimized Static Meshes based on the BSP prototype.
Developers replace the temporary BSP geometry with the final Static Meshes.

⚙️ Phase 3: Optimization (Static Meshing)
Use Unreal's tools (like Merge Actors) to combine Static Meshes for even better performance.

💻 A Peek at the Code
While most work is done in the editor, here’s how you might spawn each type via code:

Spawning a Static Mesh (Common Practice):

cpp
// Create Actor and add a Static Mesh Component
AStaticMeshActor* MyMeshActor = GetWorld()->SpawnActor<AStaticMeshActor>();

// Load and assign a Mesh Asset
UStaticMesh* SM_Cube = LoadObject<UStaticMesh>(nullptr, TEXT("/Game/Path/To/Your/Cube"));
MyMeshActor->GetStaticMeshComponent()->SetStaticMesh(SM_Cube);

// Set its location
MyMeshActor->SetActorLocation(FVector(0, 0, 50));
Creating a BSP Brush (Rare, but possible):
This is more complex and rarely done in gameplay code, as BSP is primarily an editor tool.

✅ Key Takeaway
Use BSP (🧱) for quick, iterative prototyping inside the editor. It's your draft sketch.

Use Static Meshes (🧊) for all final, performance-critical art. It's your finished masterpiece.

Understanding this distinction is crucial for an efficient and professional Unreal Engine workflow!
